"""Pure-Python DES / 3DES (ECB) for CTF work.

Written for a challenge that ships 48 bytes of ciphertext (six DES blocks) and an 8-byte
password: the fit is too exact to ignore, and the sandbox has no crypto library.

Verified against the classic test vector in the docstring of :func:`selftest_block`, so a
transcription error in any table fails loudly instead of producing plausible garbage.
Not constant-time. Do not use for anything real.
